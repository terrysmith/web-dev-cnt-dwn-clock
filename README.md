# Count Down Clock Timer

I created a simple count down timer to demostrate my css, html and javascript skills.
HTML5 and layout
CSS - grid and FLexbox
JS - Standard js with latest javascript methodologies

- The count down clock timer works as follows:
- Use the PWR button to start the count down timer.
- To reset the count down timer back to 00 - click the count down timer again to turn it off
- Use the slider to set the timer count down or adjust it while its counting down.
- Use the INCR up arrow button to increase the timer count by one minute at a time.
- USe the DECR dwn arrow button to decrease the timer count by one minute at a time.
